# AR Vocals Visualizer

## Project Overview

Welcome to the AR Vocals Visualizer app! This is an augmented reality application that transforms the way we interact with and understand vocal music. 

### Key Features 
- **Real-Time Pitch Detection**: Uses the microphone to analyze singing pitch and displays it in real time.
- **Augmented Reality Overlay**: Utilizes ARKit or unity to overlay pitch information above the singer's head as viewed through the iPhone's screen.

## Running the Project

Here are some basic guidelines to run this project after cloning the repository.

### Requirements:
- **MacOS Computer**: Your Mac needs to be running a recent MacOS version that supports the latest Xcode
- **Xcode**: The latest version of Xcode
- **iOS Device**: An iPhone or iPad with developer mode enabled.
- **Account**: An iOS developer account

### Steps to Run the Project:
1. **Install Xcode**:
   - Download the latest Xcode from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
2. **Open the Project**:
   - Launch Xcode and open the project file (`*.xcodeproj` or `*.xcworkspace`).
3. **Configure Your Apple Developer Account**:
   - Go to `Xcode > Preferences > Accounts` and log in with your Apple Developer account. If you do not have one, you will need to sign up at the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/).
4. **Connect Your iOS Device**:
   - Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a cable.
   - Trust the computer if prompted on your iOS device.
5. **Enable Developer Mode on Your iOS Device**:
   - On your iOS device, go to `Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode`
   - Turn on Developer Mode and then follow the prompts to restart your device
6. **Select Your Target Device in Xcode**:
   - In Xcode, choose your  connected device (ex. My iPhone) from the list of available devices and simulators in the toolbar. You must choose a physical device with a camera.
7. **Run the Application**:
   - Run it in Xcode (Cmd+R). Xcode will compile the application and install it on your connected device.
   - Once installed, the app will launch automatically on your device.

### Troubleshooting:
If you encounter issues, try restarting both devices, and clean the build in XCode. Watch out for memory overuse, as it can mess up the coding environment.
